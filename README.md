**FuStatus Logical Outline - Incident and Maintenance Notifications**

**fs-scrape.py (incident_method)  [completion: 100%]**

 - Scrapes status page every 5 minutes
 - main page (i.e., /status ) is the focus, older nodes are not relevant to this process
 - Nodes on page are counted and stored in a JSON array (dict)
 
**fs-item.py   [completion: 100%]**
 -  spiders each node URL from fustatus-scrape.py and scrapes for the following fields
 	```
	{
	'nodeid': '<node_id>',
	'desc': '<description_text>',
	'link': '<incident_post_url>',
	'status': 'ONGOING',
	'sub_status': None,
	'interval': None,
	'time_start': '1391706000',
	'time_end': '1391722500',
	'title': '<incident_title>â€™'
	}
	```
 - saves these entries, or 'nodes' as JSON files in a directory './incidents',  one per nodeId
 
 
**fs-event.py  [completion: 00%]**

- uses python-crontab to generate, maintain and delete cron jobs for API periodic interactions


 - monitors current status of incidents
 - indexes node files and checks for new files once every minute.
 - determines there is a new '/incident' node (file) and reads it for status ONGOING
 - When new node status is ONGOING
 - a sub-status of OPENED is assigned for the first interval (i.e., ONGOING:OPENED)
 - interval marker is set to [0]
 - file is copied to './incidents/active' directory
 - a START timestamp (POSIX), calculated from the arbitrary start time entered by agent, is recorded
 - [ACTION] API notification is sent to listening roomId(s)
 - When a node status has been ONGOING for [28]1 minutes
- Status ONGOING is verified against node file in './incidents/active'
	-OPENED sub-status is removed.
	- Interval marker is updated to [1]

**fs-action.py

- [ACTION] API notifications is sent to listening roomId(s)
```
