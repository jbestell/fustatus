 -- monitors current status of incidents
 -- indexes node files and checks for new files once every minute.
 -- determines there is a new '/incident' node (file) and reads it for status ONGOING
 -- When new node status is ONGOING
 -- a sub-status of OPENED is assigned for the first interval (i.e., ONGOING:OPENED)
 -- interval marker is set to [0]
 -- file is copied to './incidents/active' directory
 -- a START timestamp (POSIX), calculated from the arbitrary start time entered by agent, is recorded
 -- [ACTION] API notification is sent to listening roomId(s)
