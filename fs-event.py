''' fs-event.py [completion: 00%] uses python-crontab to generate, maintain and delete cron jobs for periodic API interactions

	-- monitors current 'status' of incidents in './incidents'
	-- indexes node files and checks for new files once every minute.
	-- determines there is a new '/incident' node (file) and reads it for status ONGOING
	-- When new node status is ONGOING
	-- node file is copied to './incidents/active' directory
	-- a sub-status of OPENED is assigned for the first interval (i.e., ONGOING:OPENED)
	-- interval marker is set to [0]
	-- [ACTION] API notification is sent to listening roomId(s) via fs-action.py
	-- When a node status has been ONGOING for 28 minutes
	-- Status ONGOING is verified against node file in './incidents/active' -OPENED sub-status is removed.
	-- Interval marker is updated to [1]
	-- a 'duration' timestamp (POSIX), calculated from the arbitrary start time entered by agent, is appended based on the current interval
